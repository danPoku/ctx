// MergeProjects folds project `from` into project `into` and deletes `from`.
//
// Why this exists: projects are identified by normalised git remote, but a
// session whose cwd has since vanished (a deleted or moved checkout) can no
// longer have its remote read, so it lands in a remote-less project of its
// own and project-scoped search never finds it. Think of two client files
// for the same client, opened before anyone knew they were the same person:
// merging moves every page into one folder and shreds the empty one.
//
// Rules:
//   - from and into must differ and both must exist.
//   - If both carry a git_remote they are different repos by definition, so
//     the merge is refused. If only `from` has one, `into` inherits it.
//   - Vectors of moved chunks are dropped and those chunks are marked
//     pending again: chunk_vectors.project_id is vec0's PARTITION KEY and
//     can't be updated in place (see internal/embed/worker.go), so the
//     embed worker simply re-embeds them under the new project.
//
// Everything happens in one transaction; a failure leaves both projects
// untouched.
