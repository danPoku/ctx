-- Named queries — one per MCP tool / CLI subcommand.
-- Format is sqlc-compatible (-- name: X :many), so Go code can be generated
-- from these, but they're plain SQL you can paste into the sqlite3 shell.
--
-- Scoping rule used everywhere:
--   :project_id  -> required for project scope; the app omits it for cross-project
--   :agent       -> NULL = cross-agent (everyone's files), 'codex' = within-agent

-- name: SearchHybrid :many
-- Reciprocal Rank Fusion of keyword + semantic results.
--
-- Analogy: two assessors each rank the same 50 claims. Their raw scores are on
-- different scales (BM25 vs cosine distance), so we don't average scores —
-- we average *positions*. A claim ranked 1st by one assessor and 3rd by the
-- other beats one ranked 1st by only one of them. The constant 60 damps the
-- advantage of being exactly 1st vs 2nd; it's the standard value from the
-- original RRF paper and rarely worth tuning.
--
-- NOTE: vec0 wants its filters as plain equality constraints, so the app
-- builds two variants of the `sem` CTE: with and without `AND agent = :agent`.
-- This file shows the cross-agent, project-scoped variant.
